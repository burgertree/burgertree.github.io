    <h1>About SaveSave.ca</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>SaveSave.ca</strong>, your dedicated partner in navigating the world of Canadian retail deals
      and loyalty points. Our mission is simple: to help every Canadian household stretch their dollar further by
      providing a centralized, easy-to-use platform for tracking the best offers across the country.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We believe that grocery shopping and household spending shouldn't be a source of stress. In an era of
        fluctuating prices, finding value is more important than ever. SaveSave.ca aggregates weekly flyer data from
        major retailers—including Real Canadian Superstore, Walmart, Shoppers Drug Mart, No Frills, and many more—to
        bring you the most lucrative deals and PC Optimum point opportunities in one place.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Our team (and automated tools) scan digital flyers across all provinces to identify "Magic Hour" deals,
        high-value point multipliers, and deep discounts. We organize this data into a searchable, filterable interface
        so you can plan your shopping trip in minutes instead of hours.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Independence and Transparency</h2>
      <p>SaveSave.ca is an independent platform. We are not affiliated with Loblaws, Walmart, or any other retailer. Our
        loyalty is to you, the shopper. We strive for accuracy, but always recommend verifying deals in-store as offers
        can vary by location.</p>
